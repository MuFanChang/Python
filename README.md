# Stream-learning final project

This project is using Facebook Live and OBS to stream a class's team report.
We used Python(ver3.5) and Facebook Live API to crawl audience's reaction and comment below the stream.
And we used Python to preprocess the data, R to execute optimal decision-making,and used tableau to show the result.
