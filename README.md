# Stream-learning final project

This project is using Facebook Live and OBS to stream a class's team report.
We used Python and Facebook Live API to crawl audience's reaction and comment below the stream.
And we use Python to preprocess the data, R to execute optimize decision making,and use tableau to show the result.
